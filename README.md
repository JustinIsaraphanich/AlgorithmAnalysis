# Algoritm Analysis
## This program is written in C++, the purpose of this program is to compute a random integer vector up to 100,000 data entries. 
## Three different sorting algorithms are used to sort each of the vectors: insertion sort, merge sort, and randomized select. The program gives real time data entries using the Chrono library that allows the user to see how fast in ms the sorting occurs.

## After completion of the program, it will output the data onto an Excel sheet.
